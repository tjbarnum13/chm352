# CHM352: Quantum Chemistry

This repository contains notebooks and code for use in CHM 352 at Union College. Much of the content has been borrowed and adapted from excellent resources developed by other educators. Each file attempts to give full credit and attribution to those involved in the development.

Students can navigate directly to the notebooks folder and then select the desired folder for the particular lab session, problem set, or exam that they are working on.
