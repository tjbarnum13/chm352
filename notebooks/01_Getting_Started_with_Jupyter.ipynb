However, the standard scientific packages for Python including [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](http://scipy.org/), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) provide a very powerful suite of tools that have recently found widespread use in physics, astronomy, quantitative biology, data science, and many other areas.\n","\n","If you already have a setup on your machine that works for you, great.  If not, by far the easiest way to get up and running with scientific Python and all the tools you need is to install a *distribution*. We strongly recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which is free and open source. Note that you will need to download Anaconda even if you've previously had Python set up on your computer. Of course, if you've already installed Anaconda for some other purpose, you can ignore what follows.\n","\n","1. Visit [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) from which you can download Anaconda.\n","2. Select the operating system your computer has -- Anaconda is available for both Windows (32 and 64 bit), OS X, and Linux.\n","3. You'll need to select a Python version. We suggest 3.8. \n","4. Download the installer (it might take a few minutes) and follow the instructions.\n","\n","That's it!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Getting started with Google Colaboratory\n","\n","If you have an old laptop with insufficient disk space or *really* don't want to fuss around with downloading new software, there is another option. Google Colaboratory (\"Colab\") is a free tool that allows one to write and execute Python code directly in your web browser. The computation is all done remotely on servers hosted by Google.\n","\n","There are some disadvantages to this approach. Your local files are not accessible to Colab so files must be uploaded directly or linked to a Google Drive. Downloading files programatically is similarly involved. In addition, Colab sessions will time out automatically after a period of inactivity, requiring you to re-run previous code. Lastly, Colab does not have a full version of JupyterLab, which means certain nice features (like interactive `matplotlib` graphs) are not accessible.\n","\n","Despite these drawbacks, you are welcome to use Colab instead of a local Jupyter notebook, and I will do my best to support both options for our class.\n","\n","Getting started is simple:\n","\n","1. Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/.\n","2. Sign in with your Google account.\n","3.

Jupyter notebooks provide a [complete and self-contained record](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html) of your computations and analyses, and is, moreover, easy to share.

When you upload or create a new notebook, Colab will create a new \"Colab Notebooks\" folder in your Google Drive to store these notebooks for later use.\n","\n","### Starting Jupyter\n","There are several ways to launch a Jupyter notebook:\n","* Windows: Go to the Start menu and \"Search for programs and files,\" type `jupyter notebook` and select \"Jupyter notebook.\"\n","* Mac: Use the Anaconda launcher, or at a Terminal command line enter `jupyter notebook`.\n","\n","Jupyter will then open as a web page on your default web browser. \n","\n","\n","### Organizing your files and creating your first notebook\n","You will see a main page (called the **dashboard**). You can create new Jupyter notebooks or open existing ones from here. You might want to make a new notebook every time you start a new experiment or analysis, just as you might make a new word processor document every time you start writing a new paper.\n","\n","Saved Jupyter notebooks will be text files with the extension `.ipynb`. You will probably want to keep your Jupyter notebooks together in a directory or folder. The default directory you will see on the dashboard is the one from which you launched Jupyter (most likely, your home directory.) It is probably a good idea to create a new directory on your hard drive for your work. You can do this via your operating system, or via the \"New\" button on the dashboard.\n","\n","Create a new directory if you need to, then start up a new notebook by clicking on the \"New\" button on the upper right side of the dashboard and selecting \"Python notebook.\"\n","\n","You will see that your notebook has the title `Untitled`. If you click on the title, you will be able to change the title to something more meaningful. Choose a title and then click \"File\", \"Save and Checkpoint\" (or click on the disk icon in the toolbar) to save your notebook. You should see your .ipynb file either in the Dashboard or via your operating system.\n","\n","### Notebook Cells\n","Jupyter notebooks are divided into **cells**. There are two main types:\n","* **Code cells**: these are cells that allow you to write and edit Python code. Useful features include syntax highlighting and tab completion.\n","* **Markdown cells**: these are cells that are not executed, but allow you to insert commentary using a very simple markup language called Markdown. This textual description is actually part of a markdown cell, and you'll also use markdown cells to comment on your work.\n","\n","Let's start with our first code cell in which we'll import some key packages. Importing a package allows us to use it; we'll include the following lines in pretty much every notebook we use.\n","\n","Click on the first empty cell in your new Jupyter notebook.
